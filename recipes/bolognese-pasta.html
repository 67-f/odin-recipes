            <h3>Steps to make Bolognese pasta</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Heat oil in the pot; add ground beef, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and set aside in a strainer set over a bowl.</li>
                <li>Add onion, carrots, celery, and cherry tomatoes to the cooker. Cook and stir on Saute mode until soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic, Italian seasoning, and oregano and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Return ground beef back to the pot and pour in red wine. Cook until wine has reduced a bit.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, mix tomato paste, soy sauce, and cocoa powder together in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Stir tomato paste mixture into the pot, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Pour crushed tomatoes on top of the mixture and do not stir; try to keep them on top. Turn off Saute mode. Close and lock the lid.</li>
                <li>Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 4 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
                <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.</li>
                <li>Pour pasta and on top; do not stir in. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 3 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
                <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Stir in cream and Parmesan until combined. Serve.</li>
